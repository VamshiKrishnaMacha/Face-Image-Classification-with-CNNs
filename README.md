# Face Image Classification with CNNs

This repository contains a project focused on classifying face images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project demonstrates a complete workflow from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and making predictions on new data. The aim is to accurately classify face images based on gender, ethnicity, and age categories using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Project Overview

The project leverages a publicly available dataset that includes face images along with labels for gender, ethnicity, and age. The CNN model built for this project is trained to recognize these attributes and classify new face images accordingly.

### Key Features:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes normalization and handling missing values, preparing the face images for efficient learning by the CNN model.
- **CNN Model**: A custom Convolutional Neural Network architecture is implemented and trained on the dataset to perform classification tasks.
- **Evaluation and Prediction**: The model's performance is evaluated using a separate test set, and predictions are made on new data samples to demonstrate practical application.
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques to enhance the dataset and improve model generalization.

## Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The dataset is loaded, and preprocessing steps like normalization and data augmentation are applied.
2. **Model Building**: A CNN model is designed using TensorFlow and Keras, tailored for the classification of face images.
3. **Model Training**: The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset, utilizing techniques like early stopping to prevent overfitting.
4. **Evaluation**: Model performance is evaluated on a held-out test set to gauge its accuracy and generalization capabilities.
5. **Prediction**: The trained model is used to make predictions on new face images, showcasing its real-world applicability.
